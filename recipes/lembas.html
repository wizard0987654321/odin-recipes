    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lembas is a type of Elvish bread / cake / biscuit from Tolkien's writings. First made by Yavanna from a special corn, it was nutritious, and known to be ridiculously sustaining - that "One small bite will fill the stomach of a grown man", etc.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 c all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>

        <li>1/3 c brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp honey</li>
        <li>2/3 c heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract1 cup (8 oz) cream soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and mix with a well till fine granules (easiest way is with an electric mixer). Then add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Finally add the cream, honey, and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness. Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.Criss-cross each square from corner-to-corner with a knife, lightly (not cutting through the dough).</li>
        <li>Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before eating, this bread tastes better room temperature and dry. Also for more flavor you can add more cinnamon or other spices</li>
